# My personal dotfiles

This is just a little collection of things I found usefull in my
daily bash work.

The .bash_profile is based on http://natelandau.com/my-mac-osx-bash_profile/
I added some more aliases and removed parts that are not usefull to me.

Addtionally I added liquidprompt as git submodule.
